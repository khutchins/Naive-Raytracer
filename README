A naive, unfinished, (largely) uncommented, (very) basic raytracing system in C++.

The main purposes of this project are to:
A) Refresh and increase my knowledge of raytracing through the implementation of a raytracer.
B) To become familiar with using git.

As such, it is highly unlikely that you will gain any benefit from looking at this project.  You're welcome to look if you want though.

It can encorporate the following elements:
Planes
Spheres
Cameras
Point Lights

Reflection and refraction do not work.
Sphere diffuse lighting calculations somewhat work (dimmer than they should be).
Plane diffusive lighting calculations appear to work.
Point lights appear to work.
Perspective and orthogonal cameras work.
There is very naive anti-aliasing in which each value is averaged with a weighted average across all adjacent values.  It essentially just blurs the image.

This currently outputs two .bmp files for each camera in a scene: <scene_name><camera_number>.bmp and <scene_name><camera_number>_aa_naive.bmp

Usage: ./<program> <path-to-scene-file>

An example scene file is in /scenes
